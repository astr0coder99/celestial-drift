-Genre: Sci-Fi Strategy / Simulation / Exploration

-Platform: PC (Unity or Unreal Engine recommended)

-Target Audience: College students, science enthusiasts, and educators

-Core Integration: NASA real-world space data (e.g., from JPL, SOHO, TESS, Hubble, etc.)

-Concept Summary:
You’re the mission director of an independent space exploration agency competing with global powers. Your mission is to navigate the real solar system and make groundbreaking discoveries using NASA-sourced planetary and stellar data. With limited funding and time, your challenge is to build, launch, and guide spacecraft to study exoplanets, asteroid belts, black holes, and more.

-Key Features:
Use actual datasets from NASA APIs (e.g.,:Real star systems and asteroid belts (from JPL/Horizons).
Exoplanets (from NASA Exoplanet Archive).
Sunspot and solar flare data (from SOHO/TESS).
Orbital elements and gravity modeling.
Show orbits, planetary rotation, terrain, and star positioning based on real measurements.

-Build Your Fleet:
Design custom spacecraft with different modules: telescopes, propulsion systems, AI probes, gravity-assist features, etc. 
Simulate launches, orbital transfers, and slingshot maneuvers using real Newtonian physics.

-Decision-Based Missions
Missions include asteroid mining, terraforming experiments, atmospheric analysis of exoplanets, or defending Earth from near-Earth object (NEO) threats.
Students learn orbital mechanics, planetary science, and mission planning in the process.

-Time-Sensitive Phenomena
Use current solar weather and cosmic events in-game (e.g., coronal mass ejections disrupting satellites, eclipses, comet flybys).
Players can receive NASA “alerts” that influence mission conditions.

-Research & Discovery System
Discover habitable planets by analyzing atmospheric compositions, temperatures, and orbits using actual methods like transit photometry and spectroscopy.
