# Celestial Drift

**Genre:** Sci-Fi Strategy / Simulation / Exploration  
**Platform:** PC    
**Core Integration:** Real NASA data from JPL, SOHO, TESS, Hubble, and more  

## Concept Overview

In *Celestial Drift*, you lead an independent space exploration agency competing against global powers. Your mission is to navigate the real solar system and make groundbreaking discoveries using authentic NASA planetary and stellar data. With limited funding and time, you will design, launch, and guide spacecraft to study exoplanets, asteroid belts, black holes, and other cosmic phenomena.

## Key Features

- **Authentic NASA Data:** Incorporates real star systems and asteroid belts (via JPL Horizons), exoplanet information (NASA Exoplanet Archive), solar activity (SOHO, TESS), and accurate orbital and gravitational modeling.

- **Realistic Simulation:** Visualize orbits, planetary rotation, terrain, and star positions based on measured astronomical data.

- **Custom Spacecraft Design:** Build your fleet by assembling modules like telescopes, propulsion units, AI probes, and gravity-assist systems. Simulate launches, orbital transfers, and gravity slingshots using Newtonian physics.

- **Dynamic Missions:** Engage in varied missions including asteroid mining, terraforming experiments, exoplanet atmospheric analysis, and defending Earth from near-Earth objects (NEOs).

- **Time-Sensitive Events:** React to real-time cosmic phenomena such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, eclipses, and comet flybys that impact mission success.

- **Research & Discovery:** Analyze data with authentic scientific methods like transit photometry and spectroscopy to identify habitable worlds and unlock new technologies.


*Celestial Drift* combines scientific rigor with immersive gameplay to educate and challenge players while showcasing the wonders of our universe.
